\opening{Dear Editors,}

I am writing on behalf of my coauthors to resubmit our manuscript entitled
\emph{Demes: a standard format for demographic models}
for consideration for publication in GENETICS
as a ``Methods, Technology, and Resources'' article.

We thank the reviewers for their insightful and helpful reviews. We
believe that we have answered all questions raised, leading to a more
clearly structured manuscript. We have attached
a detailed point-by-point response in the \texttt{response-to-reviewers.pdf}
file. The revised manuscript (converted to GENETICS format) is
attached as \texttt{paper.pdf}.

We have also attached a file showing the changes made to the manuscript
in response to reviewers in \texttt{review-diff.pdf}.

Since the initial submission we have added two further authors:
Stephan Schiffels
for his work in adding Demes support
to MSMC, and Gertjan Bisschop for his work in adding
Demes support to gIMble.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
